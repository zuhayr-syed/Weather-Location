# Weather-Location

## JavaScript, React

• Developed a JavaScript web application using the React framework for users to enter any location to view its current temperature and weather condition

• Parsed JSON weather data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API to make calls to a RESTFUL API

• Implemented images to change the application’s background to either warm or cold, depending on the temperature • Built a front-end user interface which displays the location, current date, and weather using React, HTML, and CSS
